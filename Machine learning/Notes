There are a large number of typical inductive learning problems. The primary difference between them is in
what type of thing they’re trying to predict.

Here are some examples:

Regression: trying to predict a real value. For instance, predict the value of a stock tomorrow given its
past performance. Or predict Alice’s score on the machine learning final exam based on her homework scores.

Binary Classification: trying to predict a simple yes/no response. For instance, predict whether Alice will
enjoy a course or not. Or predict whether a user review of the newest Apple product is positive or negative about the product.

Multiclass Classification: trying to put an example into one of a num- ber of classes. For instance,
predict whether a news story is about entertainment, sports, politics, religion, etc. Or predict whether a CS
course is Systems, Theory, AI or Other.

Ranking: trying to put a set of objects in order of relevance. For in- stance, predicting what order to
put web pages in, in response to a user query. Or predict Alice’s ranked preferences over courses she hasn’t taken.
